# ☕💻 SecondSemesterProgramming — Java

Personal repository documenting my evolution during the **second semester of Computer Engineering**, with a strong focus on Java.

After a first semester centered around Python, this repository represents my transition into **Java** — a more structured, strongly typed language widely used in professional software development.

Here I store exercises, practice sessions, exam simulations, and small projects that reflect my progress in:
- Control structures  
- Data handling (strings, vectors, matrices)  
- Object-oriented programming  
- Applied logic and structured problem solving  

This repository is **not about perfect code** —  
it’s about **learning, consistency, and growth**.

## 👤 Who I Am

My name is Álvaro, and I am currently studying **Computer Engineering** at **:contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0} (UJI)**.

This repository is part of my learning journey:  
a place where I track my progress, challenge myself, and build the foundations of my technical identity as a future engineer.

## 🎯 Why I Started This Second-Semester Repository

After completing my first semester with Python, I wanted to continue documenting my development — this time in Java.

Java forces me to think more formally:

- Strict typing  
- Explicit structure  
- Compilation-based workflow  
- Clear separation of logic  

Maintaining this repository helps me:
- Understand the differences between Python and Java  
- Practice real programming patterns  
- Build discipline through typed and structured code  
- Keep a clear record of my evolution as a developer

## 📁 Repository Structure

### 📂 Basics/
First contact with Java syntax:
- Variables, types, operators  
- Input / output  
- Simple programs to understand compilation and execution flow  

---

### 📂 ControlStructures/
Exercises focused on strengthening logic using control structures.

Includes three main areas:

#### 🧵 Cadenas/
- String manipulation exercises  
- Digit counting, pattern detection, uppercase streaks, etc.  

#### ➿ Vectores/
- Array operations: insertion, alternation, filtering, non-repetition  
- Logic-heavy exercises to reinforce indexing and iteration  

#### 🔢 Matrices/
- Matrix traversal, sums, maximums, transposition, element search  
- Strong preparation for more advanced data structures  

---

### 📂 Estructuras/
Reusable templates and utilities:
- Vector and matrix creation  
- Menus  
- Scanner setups  

These structures help build clean, reusable, and well-organized code for larger exercises.

---

### 📂 PruebaExamen1/
A focused folder dedicated to **exam preparation**.

Contains short, complete exercises designed to simulate the **first practical exam of Programming II**, including:
- Palindrome checking  
- Vector ordering  
- Matrix validation  
- Mixed return types (`boolean`, `void`, arrays)  

This folder represents my **exam warm-up zone** — simple, clear, and designed for working under time pressure.

---

### 📂 EjercicioFinal1/
A combined practice exercise that brings together:
- Strings  
- Vectors  
- Matrices  
- Different method return types  

A solid checkpoint of my overall understanding before the exam.

## 🧠 Repository Goals

- Consolidate Java fundamentals  
- Strengthen problem-solving skills through structured programming  
- Document my technical and personal evolution during the semester  
- Build a portfolio that reflects real learning, not just finished code  
- Prepare effectively for practical exams through targeted exercises

## 🚀 What This Repository Represents

This repository is not about perfect code.  
It is about **growth, discipline, and curiosity**.

Every file, commit, and experiment reflects my transition from Python’s flexibility to Java’s structure.  
It shows how I learn, how I think, and how I improve — a personal and technical record of my journey as a developing engineer.

---

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Expand object-oriented programming projects with multiple classes  
- Practice file handling and data persistence  
- Implement small algorithms and utilities  
- Continue preparing for upcoming exams  
- Build more complete and interactive Java applications
