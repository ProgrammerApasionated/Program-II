# SecondSemesterProgramming – Java ☕💻

Personal repository documenting my evolution during the **second semester of Computer Engineering**.

After a first semester focused on **Python**, this new space represents my transition to **Java** — a more structured, strongly typed language commonly used in large-scale systems.  
Here I store exercises, practices, small projects, and experiments that reflect my progress in **object-oriented programming**, **control structures**, **data handling**, and **applied logic**.

## 👤 Who I Am

My name is **Álvaro**, and I’m currently studying **Computer Engineering at UJI**.

This repository is part of my learning journey:  
a place where I track my growth, challenge myself, and build the foundations of my **technical identity** as a future engineer.

## 🎯 Why I Started This Second-Semester Repository

After completing my first semester with Python, I wanted to keep documenting my progress — this time in **Java**.

Java is stricter, more formal, and closer to the languages used in professional software development.  
Creating this repository helps me:

- Understand the differences between **Python and Java**
- Practice real programming structures
- Build discipline through **typed code and compilation**
- Keep a record of my evolution as a developer

## 📁 Repository Structure

### `Basics/`
- First contact with Java syntax  
- Variables, data types, operators, input/output  
- Simple programs to understand compilation and execution flow  

### `ControlStructures/`
- Exercises using `if`, `else`, `switch`, `for`, `while`, and `do-while`
- Small challenges to strengthen logic and flow control  

### `Functions/`
- Introduction to methods, parameters, and return values
- Modular design and reusable logic  

### `ObjectOrientedProgramming/`
- First steps with classes, objects, constructors, attributes, and methods
- Understanding encapsulation and the foundations of OOP  

### `Projects/`
- Small programs combining everything learned
- Interactive menus, user input, loops, and structured logic
- Early attempts at building complete, functional applications

## 🧠 Repository Goals

- Consolidate **Java fundamentals**
- Strengthen problem-solving skills through structured programming
- Document my **technical and personal evolution** during the semester
- Build a portfolio that reflects **real learning**, not just finished code

## 🚀 What This Repository Represents

This is **not** about having perfect code.  
It’s about **growth, discipline, and curiosity**.

Every file, commit, and experiment reflects my transition from Python’s flexibility to Java’s structure.  
It shows how I learn, how I think, and how I improve — a personal and technical record of my journey as a developing engineer.

## 🔮 Next Steps

- Expand OOP projects with multiple classes
- Practice file handling and data persistence in Java
- Implement small algorithms and utilities
- Prepare for more advanced subjects and future semesters
