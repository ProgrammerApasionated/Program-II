# 📁 Estructuras
### My Personal Java Foundations

This folder contains a small collection of **fundamental Java structures** I built to support my learning during the second semester.

They are not meant to be complex or polished.  
Their purpose is to provide **clarity, speed, and reusable mental patterns** when solving larger problems.

Coming from Python, I quickly realized that Java demands much more explicit structure:
everything must be defined, types must be considered, and boilerplate is unavoidable.

Instead of letting that slow me down, I created these small **building blocks** to avoid rewriting the same setup every time I start a new exercise.

This folder is essentially **my personal framework for Java basics**.

## 🎯 Purpose of These Structures

The goal behind these files is simple:

- Have clean, ready-to-use templates for vectors, matrices, menus, and input handling
- Reduce the time spent rewriting repetitive logic
- Strengthen my understanding of Java’s structure through repetition
- Build a mental toolkit I can rely on when solving more complex problems
- Focus on algorithms instead of setup

These files are not about perfection — they are about **utility and clarity**.

## 🧩 Included Structures

### 1. `EstructuraCrearMatriz.java`
A basic template for creating a **matrix using user input**.

The program asks for dimensions, allocates the matrix, and fills it element by element.

**What this structure provides:**
- A quick way to generate test matrices
- A consistent pattern for nested loops
- Practice with indexing and input validation
- A solid foundation for matrix-based exercises

---

### 2. `EstructuraCrearVector.java`
A simple structure for creating a **vector of any size**.

It reads the dimension, fills the array, and prints it using `Arrays.toString()`.

**Why it matters:**
- Vectors appear constantly in exams and exercises
- Having a clean template saves time
- Reinforces loop patterns and array handling
- Helps me focus on the algorithm instead of the setup

### 3. `EstructuraMenu.java`
A small **interactive menu** that allows the user to create vectors or variables depending on their choice.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Menu-driven programs
- Control flow using loops and conditionals
- Modularity through helper methods
- Common user interaction patterns

This structure is especially useful since many exam-style problems rely on menus, loops, and repeated user input.

### 4. `EstructuraScanner.java`
A minimal example demonstrating how to use `Scanner` for input handling.

It may look trivial, but it represents the foundation of almost every Java program I write.

**Why I keep it:**
- Reinforces correct input handling
- Serves as a quick reference
- Keeps my workflow consistent

## 🌱 Why This Folder Exists

These structures are not “projects”.  
They are **tools** — small, reusable pieces of logic that help me think faster and code with more confidence.

They remind me that programming is not about writing perfect code from scratch every time.  
It’s about building reliable patterns, understanding how things work, and using that knowledge to solve bigger problems.

This folder reflects my personal evolution:  
a place where I shape the foundations of how I write Java.

## 🔮 How I Use These Structures

Whenever I start a new exercise — vectors, matrices, menus, or algorithms — I return to this folder.

These files give me:
- A starting point
- A clear mental model
- A consistent structure
- A way to avoid unnecessary friction

They help me focus on **logic, not boilerplate**.
