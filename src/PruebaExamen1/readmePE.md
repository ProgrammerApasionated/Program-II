# 📘 PruebaExamen1
### First Practical Exam Prep (Java)

This folder contains a small collection of **focused practice exercises** created to prepare for the first practical exam of *Programming II*.

The goal here is **not** to build polished or complex software.  
Instead, it is to train logic, reinforce fundamentals, and simulate the exact type of problems that appear in a **40-minute written Java exam**.

These exercises helped me review the core topics of the course using simple, self-contained methods that test:

- String manipulation
- Vector (array) operations
- Matrix handling
- Different return types (`boolean`, `void`, arrays)
- Control flow and logical reasoning under time pressure

This folder represents a **snapshot of my learning process**, not a finished project.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

The idea behind **PruebaExamen1** is simple:

Practice the same kind of exercises that appear in early Java exams —  
short, logical, and focused on fundamentals.

Each method in this folder is designed to be:
- Small enough to write by hand
- Clear enough to understand quickly
- Useful for reviewing syntax and structure
- Representative of typical exam questions

This is my personal **exam warm-up zone**.

## 📂 What’s Inside

### ✔ `esPalindromo(String)`
A method that returns a `boolean`.  
It checks whether a string is a palindrome by manually reversing it and comparing characters.

**Good for practicing:**
- Loops
- Character access
- String logic
- Boolean return values

---

### ✔ `estaOrdenado(int[])`
A `void` method that prints whether a vector is sorted in ascending order.

**Good for practicing:**
- Array traversal
- Comparing consecutive elements
- Early stopping using `break`
- Writing clear and precise output

---

### ✔ `matrizSinCeros(int[][])`
A method that returns a matrix or `null`.

It checks whether a matrix contains any zeros.  
If no zeros are found, it returns a full copy of the matrix.

**Good for practicing:**
- Nested loops
- Matrix indexing
- Conditional checks
- Returning complex data structures

---

## 🧠 Why These Exercises Matter

These problems cover the **core logic patterns** that appear repeatedly in Java exams:

- Scanning a data structure
- Checking conditions
- Returning results
- Writing clean and correct loops
- Avoiding off-by-one errors
- Thinking step by step

They are simple exercises, but they force a deep understanding of the fundamentals —  
the kind of understanding that actually matters in a written exam.

## 📝 How I Use This Folder

- As a quick review before the exam
- To practice writing code without an IDE
- To reinforce syntax and structure
- To build confidence by solving complete, small problems
- To track my progress as I move toward more complex Java topics

This folder is intentionally **small and focused**.  
It’s not a project — it’s a **study tool**.

## 🚀 Final Thoughts

**PruebaExamen1** is part of my journey through *Programming II*.  
It reflects the mindset of a student preparing seriously:

- Learning by doing
- Practicing fundamentals
- Building confidence one exercise at a time

It’s not perfect code —  
it’s **learning in motion**.
