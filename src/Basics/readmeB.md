# 📁 EjerciciosSimples
### First Steps Into Java Logic

This folder contains my earliest Java exercises — small, focused programs that helped me transition from Python’s flexible, dynamic style to Java’s stricter and more structured environment.

These files are **not meant to be perfect or advanced**.  
They represent practice, iteration, and the learning process of thinking in Java: typed variables, explicit control flow, and a more disciplined approach to problem-solving.

Each exercise focuses on a single concept, reinforcing the foundations needed before moving on to more complex topics such as arrays, matrices, or object-oriented programming.

## 🧩 Exercises Included

### 1. `DivisoresPropios.java`
Calculates the **proper divisors** of a given number.

The program iterates from `1` to `n / 2` to avoid unnecessary checks and prints each divisor found.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Basic loop design
- Modulo operator logic
- Simple algorithmic optimizations
- User input handling

This exercise helped me understand how to structure small algorithms in Java without relying on Python’s shortcuts.

### 2. `Factorial.java`
Computes the **factorial** of a number using a descending loop and an accumulator variable.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Iterative multiplication
- Accumulator patterns
- Integer arithmetic
- Translating mathematical ideas into explicit code

A classic beginner exercise, but a good reminder that even simple logic becomes more explicit and structured in Java.

### 3. `ParImpar.java`
Reads a number and determines whether it is **even or odd**.

**Concepts practiced:**
- Conditional branching (`if / else`)
- Modulo operator
- Clean input/output
- Writing minimal and readable logic

One of my first steps in expressing decision-making using Java’s control structures.

## 🎯 Why These Exercises Matter

These programs are intentionally simple.  
Their goal is not to impress, but to build **discipline and foundations**:

- Writing clear and structured code
- Understanding Java’s syntax and execution flow
- Practicing small, self-contained problems
- Learning to think step by step instead of relying on dynamic typing

They form the base on which the rest of this repository grows.
